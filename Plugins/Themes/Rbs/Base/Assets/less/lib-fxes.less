 * Fix cursor on some elements.
 *    "Original Bootstrap's CSS depends on empty href attributes to style cursors for several components (pagination, tabs etc.).
 *     But in AngularJS adding empty href attributes to link tags will cause unwanted route changes. This is why we need to
 *     remove empty href attributes from directive templates and as a result styling is not applied correctly."
